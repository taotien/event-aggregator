To run on desktop:

steps in terminal (windows):

To run on browser:
NOTE: UI works, but fetch is blocked by USF server CORS policy (or lack thereof).

There should be a pre-built version in event-ui/dist, or online at https://taotien.github.io/event-engine/, but in case those don't work:

extra dependencies:
trunk (https://trunkrs.dev)

steps in terminal:
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cd [path/to/event-engine]
