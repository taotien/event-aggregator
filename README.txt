event engine is a program that fetches event listings from websites that list them, filters, and exports to your favorite calendar. Currently it only scrapes the USF Events Calendar. To get started, please run the program locally and click "Fetch USF Events"

Difficulties:
I didn't realize browser networking security would stop the web version of this program to not function, and it would be too difficult to set up a reliable proxy to get around the CORS limitations.
